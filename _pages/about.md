Dr. Leanne Dong graduated from a PhD in Mathematical Statistics during 2018 at the University of Sydney. She joined CTDS in January 2019, carries on Deep Learning research at the Centre of Translational Data Science. She is also a passionate teacher, tutoring Machine Learning and Times series at the discipline of business analystics (USYD). She has received formal undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications in Mathematics, Statistics, Accounting, Economics and Finance. The main theme of her PhD research lies in stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with stable LÃ©vy noise. She worked on Stochastic PDE from a probabilistic point of view but use classical partial differential equations and functional analysis results for motivation and guidance. Her current research focus on the applications of stochastic analysis and Probalistic Machine Learning. She is interested in the applications in Financial Engineering, Social Science and Geophysics.
