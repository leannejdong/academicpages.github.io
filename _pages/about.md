Dr. Leanne Dong graduated from a PhD in Mathematical Statistics during 2018 at the University of Sydney. She joined CTDS in January 2019, carries on Deep Learning research at the Centre of Translational Data Science. She is also a passionate teacher, tutoring Mathematics, Data science, Machine Learning and Financial Econometric at the discipline of business analystics (USYD) and UTS. She has received formal undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications in Mathematics, Statistics, Accounting, Economics and Finance. Her PhD is around finite and infinite dimensional, deterministic and stochastic (nonlinear) PDE. Her research is interdisciplinary, involving many tools from Pure Mathematics (functional analysis, stochastic analysis, measure theory, differential geometry and PDE theory) to tackle complex real world problems in Natural Science, Engineering and Finance. The main theme of her PhD research lies in stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with stable LÃ©vy noise. She worked on Stochastic PDE from a probabilistic point of view but use classical partial differential equations and functional analysis results for motivation and guidance. Her current research interests lie in the applications of stochastic analysis and Probalistic Machine Learning. She is interested in the applications in Financial Engineering, Social Science and Geophysics.
