Hi! I am a visiting Researcher @ [UTS Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-engineering-and-information-technology/computer-science), was working at the intersection of  Machine Learning, Statistics, Computer Social science and Scientific computing. Recently I completed my first postdoc. in social computing. I built dependence structure between labor occupation based on job counts data,  using copulae. I also developed a theoretical model based on hawkes intensity point processes allows fitting information diffusion based on observed counts of events. The main tools we used were functional analysis and distribution theory. I have been a fan of C++, an open source advocate. These days I am dabbling quantum computing, deep learning. **Please note other parts of my homepage are bits out of dated. My Linkedin page is perhaps more updated where I frequently exchange thoughts in the relevant communities of AI, Quantum, Maths, C++ and more.**

**Research interests**: 

* Quantum Computing, Information Geometry and Coding theory, Quantum Machine Learning
