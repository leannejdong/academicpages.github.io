Hi! I am a Mathematician and a Postdoc research scientist @ [Concordia University, School of Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody.html). I am currently working on network simulation and 
a PDE approach to Explainable deep learning . I completed my last postdoc in computer social media, [FEIT, UTS](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/leanne.dong). I built dependence structure between labor occupation based on job counts data,  using copulae. I also developed a theoretical model based on hawkes intensity point processes allows fitting information diffusion based on observed counts of events. The main tools we used were functional analysis and distribution theory. I completed my [PhD](https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/ut/people?who=LJ_Dong) in early 2018 on the topic of stochastic Navier-Stokes equations on the rotating spheres with stable LÃ©vy noise, under supervision of Prof. Beniamin Goldys, the univeristy of Sydney.
