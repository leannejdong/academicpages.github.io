I graduated from a PhD in Theoretical Probability in 2018 at the University of Sydney. I received formal undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications in Mathematics, Statistics, Accounting, Economics and Finance. My PhD is around finite and infinite dimensional, deterministic and stochastic (nonlinear) PDE. Her research is interdisciplinary, involving many tools from Pure Mathematics (functional analysis, stochastic analysis, measure theory, differential geometry and PDE theory) to tackle complex real world problems in Natural Science, Engineering and Finance. The main theme of my PhD research lies in stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with stable LÃ©vy noise. I worked on Stochastic PDE from a probabilistic point of view but use classical PDE and functional analysis results for motivation and guidance. Between January-May 2019, I  carried on research in Probablistic Deep Learning at the Centre of Translational Data Science as an intern and now remain as an affiliate researcher. I also enjoy teaching, tutoring Mathematics, Data science, Machine Learning and Financial Econometric around USYD and UTS. Currently, I work as a Postdoctoral Research Associate @ UTS Faculty of Engineering&IT. (Mentor: Dr. Marian-Andrei Rizoiu). Presently I am keen about developing new Mathematical tools for Machine Learners using functional analysis and distribution theory. My aim is to make Machine Learning algorithms implemented in a well justified, robust, scalable fashion. My current research roughly two-fold:

* Theoretical development of Stochastic Information Diffusion models for modelling online behaviour, based on an exogenously-driven Hawkes self-exciting processes. 

* Adaptative Skills Taxonomy/Machine Learning approach to Labor economics
