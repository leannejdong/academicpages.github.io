Hi! I am a Mathematician and a research scientist @ [Concordia University, School of Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody.html). I am currently working at the interface of theoretical computer science and electrical engineering. I primarily work with the extend C++ library of INSEL engine to a undirected graph concepts, which could be used to model multimodal networks of electricity, gas and water. I completed my last postdoc in computer social media, FEIT, UTS. I built dependence structure between labor occupation based on job counts data,  using copulae. I also developed a theoretical model based on hawkes intensity point processes allows fitting information diffusion based on observed counts of events. The main tools we used were functional analysis and distribution theory.
