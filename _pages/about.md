Dr. Leanne Dong graduated from a PhD in Theoretical Probability in 2018 at the University of Sydney. She has received formal undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications in Mathematics, Statistics, Accounting, Economics and Finance. Her PhD is around finite and infinite dimensional, deterministic and stochastic (nonlinear) PDE. Her research is interdisciplinary, involving many tools from Pure Mathematics (functional analysis, stochastic analysis, measure theory, differential geometry and PDE theory) to tackle complex real world problems in Natural Science, Engineering and Finance. The main theme of her PhD research lies in stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with stable LÃ©vy noise. She worked on Stochastic PDE from a probabilistic point of view but use classical PDE and functional analysis results for motivation and guidance. Since January 2019, She carries on research in Probablistic Deep Learning at the Centre of Translational Data Science as an affiliate researcher. She is also a dedicated teacher, tutoring Mathematics, Data science, Machine Learning and Financial Econometric around USYD and UTS. Recently, she moved to UTS School of Computer Science as a Machine Learning Researcher (Mentor: Dr. Marian-Andrei Rizoiu). Her work primarily concerns with the theoretical development of Stochastic Information Diffusion models with partially observed/interval-censored processes for social media analytics. Her current research interests lie at the interplay of stochastic analysis and Probalistic Machine Learning. She is interested in developing novel Machine Learning algorithms/models/prototypes with tools from functional analysis, control theory, and theory of PDE/DE.
Some potential applications could be Financial Engineering (such as High Frequency Algo Trading, Credit Risk, Contagion Pricing), Social Science, Epidemics and Geophysics.

From 2020, she will be heading up to Montreal working on her second Postdoctoral project on Theoretical Machine Learning interface with Physics and Stochastic analysis.
