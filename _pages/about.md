Dr. Leanne Dong graduated from a PhD in Theoretical Probability during 2018 at the University of Sydney. She joined CTDS in January 2019 as an affiliate researcher, carries on Deep Learning research at the Centre of Translational Data Science. She is also a dedicated teacher, tutoring Mathematics, Data science, Machine Learning and Financial Econometric around USYD and UTS. Recently she joined UTS school of software as a Research Associate, working on development of novel Machine Learning algorithms and Mathematical models with Hawkes intensity processes to predict social media popularity. She has received formal undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications in Mathematics, Statistics, Accounting, Economics and Finance. Her PhD is around finite and infinite dimensional, deterministic and stochastic (nonlinear) PDE. Her research is interdisciplinary, involving many tools from Pure Mathematics (functional analysis, stochastic analysis, measure theory, differential geometry and PDE theory) to tackle complex real world problems in Natural Science, Engineering and Finance. The main theme of her PhD research lies in stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with stable LÃ©vy noise. She worked on Stochastic PDE from a probabilistic point of view but use classical PDE and functional analysis results for motivation and guidance. Her current research interests lie at the interplay of stochastic analysis and Probalistic Machine Learning. She is interested in developing ML algorithms and novel mathematical models with tools from functional analysis, control theory, and theory of PDE/DE.
Some potential applications could be Financial Engineering, Economics, Social Science and Geophysics.
