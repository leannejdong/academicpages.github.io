Lévy Processes
======

A **Lévy process** is a continuous-time stochastic process $(X_t,t\ge 0)$
with

* **stationary increments**: $X_{t+s}-X_t$ has the same distribution as $X_s$ for all $t\ge 0, s\ge 0$,

* **independent increments**: $X_{t+s}-X_s$ and $X_s$ are independent for all $0\le s \le s+t$ ,

*  **c\`adl\`ag paths**: $t\mapsto X_t$ is a.s. right-continuous with left limits


You can have many headings
======

Aren't headings cool?
